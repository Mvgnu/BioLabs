- `governance/operator_sop.md`: Operational playbook covering cross-surface guardrails and escalation procedures.
- `planning/README.md`: Index for forward-looking implementation plans (cloning orchestrator, DNA assets, documentation readiness).
- `dna_assets.md`: Captures the initial DNA asset lifecycle foundation including data model, services, routes, and validation coverage.
