# Reflection – 2025-07-08 – Guardrail Hardening

- purpose: capture lessons from deprecating legacy export surfaces and normalising packaging telemetry
- status: draft
- related_docs: docs/governance/export_enforcement_audit.md, docs/governance/operator_sop.md, progress.md

## Wins
- Removing direct notebook and inventory exports instantly closed the last known bypasses, and the new guardrail events give operators an audit trail when those surfaces are attempted.
- Normalising the `state/context` payload made it easier to reason about telemetry consumers—dashboards, workers, and CLI now share a concise contract.

## Challenges
- Notebook exports relied on per-request PDF generation with no governance context; pivoting to a guardrail block required careful messaging so teams understand the new narrative workflow requirement.
- Keeping telemetry lean meant trimming payloads without losing the data dashboards rely on; documenting the contract helped ensure future contributors respect the boundary.

## Next Steps
- Wire the DNA asset governance work so the inventory export replacement provides fully approved dossiers.
- Expand frontend governance surfaces to surface the guardrail block reasons directly within notebook and inventory UIs.
