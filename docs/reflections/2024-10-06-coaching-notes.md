# 2024-10-06 – Coaching Collaboration Lift-Off

## Highlights
- Stitched the new `governance_coaching_notes` table into override lineage to persist threaded reviewer rationale with RBAC-aware access control.
- Delivered FastAPI endpoints for listing, creating, and updating notes with optimistic metadata (`reply_count`, `moderation_state`) to unblock UI composition tooling.
- Expanded the decision timeline aggregator so coaching activity appears alongside overrides, baselines, and analytics for unified operator situational awareness.

## Friction & Mitigations
- RBAC rules span override actors, execution owners, and team ladders; codified a helper that reuses baseline/template team ids to avoid duplicating membership logic.
- Thread reply counts risked expensive recounts; constrained aggregation queries to requested root ids where possible to keep pagination snappy.

## Principle Adjustments
- Reinforced Principle #3 (“Living Documentation”) by pairing schema tags in `models.py`/`schemas.py` with refreshed governance timeline docs.
- Highlighted the need to expand analytics invalidation and optimistic cache publishing in the next iteration so coaching events reflect instantly in the console UI.
