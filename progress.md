# Progress Log

## 2025-07-05
- Added guardrail simulation history to narrative export payloads and console UI, ensuring governance routes, experiment console, and tests surface blocked vs clear forecasts with inline audit trails.
- Routed narrative export scheduling through `record_packaging_queue_state`, logging queue vs awaiting events consistently and preventing Celery dispatch until ladders finalize across experiment console and governance surfaces.
- Hardened narrative packaging gating by reusing ladder loaders in the worker, logging `narrative_export.packaging.awaiting_approval`, and asserting the behavior with a new end-to-end test.
- Enhanced SLA monitoring to mark overdue stages, record escalation actions/events, send reviewer notifications, and surface mean resolution timing + breach counts in governance analytics meta.
- Introduced persisted guardrail simulation APIs at `/api/governance/guardrails/simulations`, backed by a new model, schemas, and pytest coverage for RBAC and persistence flows.
- Extended guardrail simulation coverage with multi-stage `clear` scenarios to ensure persisted records and listings stay in sync without false delay projections.
- Embedded guardrail forecasts into narrative export responses and console UI, surfacing projected delays, disabling blocked approvals, and wiring governance widgets to the persisted simulations feed.

## 2025-07-03
- Authored `docs/approval_workflow_design.md` capturing staged approval models, APIs, worker hooks, frontend ladder UX, and test matrix.
- Updated documentation index to reference the new design and logged follow-on compliance considerations.

## 2025-07-04
- Refactored narrative approval state transitions into `backend/app/services/approval_ladders.py` so console and governance APIs reuse the same logic, analytics invalidation, and packaging triggers.
- Introduced governance approval endpoints under `/api/governance/exports/*` with pytest coverage plus cached stage metrics feeding governance analytics reports.
- Documented the shared ladder services and governance endpoints in `backend/app/README.md` to keep operator playbooks current.

## 2025-07-05 - Compliance Narrative Evidence Loop

- Persisted Markdown narrative exports with `execution_narrative_exports` and attachment tables capturing bundled timeline evidence and file references.
- Added export history, creation, and approval endpoints plus timeline events for creation and decisions.
- Extended React hooks with export creation, listing, and approval mutations wired into React Query caches.
- Introduced `ExportsPanel` UI for scientists to bundle evidence, submit exports, and record signatures directly from the experiment console.

## 2025-07-06 - Guardrail Forecast Surfacing

- Updated approval ladder services to return latest guardrail simulations and block packaging dispatch when forecasts are `blocked`, recording audit events for operators.
- Injected guardrail projections into experiment console export payloads, adding tooltips, badges, and disabled states for risky stages alongside projected delay messaging.
- Normalised guardrail payloads in governance API clients and experiment console hooks so React components consume typed summaries consistently.
- Expanded backend pytest coverage to ensure guardrail summaries surface through export history responses and added Vitest assertions for the disabled-stage experience.
