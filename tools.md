# Data Analysis & ML Tools

This document outlines Python libraries that are most relevant to the BioLabs architecture. These packages can be used in custom analysis tools and notebook workflows.

## Core Data Libraries
- **NumPy** – base n-dimensional array library used for numerical computation.
- **Pandas** – data manipulation with DataFrames, great for tabular lab data.
- **SciPy** – scientific algorithms built on NumPy (optimization, statistics, etc.).

## Visualization
- **Matplotlib** – publication quality static plots.
- **Seaborn** – statistical plotting built on Matplotlib.

## Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn** – classic ML algorithms and model utilities.
- **XGBoost / LightGBM** – high performance gradient boosting.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – deep learning frameworks for complex models.

## Interactive Computing
- **JupyterLab** – notebook environment for exploratory analysis.

These libraries complement existing packages like BioPython and can be installed in the backend environment to power custom scripts and analysis endpoints.

## Integration Plan
1. Add the core libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to backend requirements.
2. Provide a simple data analysis endpoint that summarizes uploaded CSV files using Pandas.
3. Allow analysis tools to leverage these libraries for advanced workflows.
