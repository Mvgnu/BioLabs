## Problem Statement
Unable to create a pull request using the `make_pr` tool; invocation returns `"make_pr may only be called once"` even though no PR was created in this session.

## Metadata
Status: Open
Priority: Medium
Type: Tool Failure
Suspected_Tool: make_pr
Next_Target: Document workaround and notify maintainers

## Current Hypothesis
A prior automation invocation already consumed the single allowed `make_pr` call for this workspace, preventing the current agent from issuing the PR message despite successful commits.

## Log of Attempts (Chronological)
- 2025-07-09T02:26Z — Attempted to call `make_pr` with summary/testing template immediately after committing; tool responded with `make_pr may only be called once` and aborted.
- 2025-07-09T02:27Z — Retried `make_pr` with identical payload to confirm behavior; failure reproduced with the same error message.

## Resolution Summary
Pending — requires maintainer intervention or reset of the `make_pr` tool usage counter so a PR can be generated after future commits.
