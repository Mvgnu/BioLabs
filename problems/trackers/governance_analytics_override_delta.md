## Problem Statement
Governance analytics preview summaries crash when override reassign events are processed because `_apply_reassign_override_effect` returns `None`, leading to `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'float' and 'NoneType'` during ladder delta aggregation.

## Metadata
Status: Resolved
Priority: High

## Current Hypothesis
Reassign override handling fails to compute a numeric ladder delta when reconciling reviewer assignments, especially after enterprise compliance migrations introduced richer override payloads with reversal states.

## Log of Attempts (Chronological)
- 2024-03-18 10:20 UTC — Identified failing test `test_governance_analytics_override_events_adjust_metrics` reproducing crash in `/api/governance/analytics` when reassign overrides are stored. Confirmed the ladder delta accumulator receives `None` from `_apply_reassign_override_effect`.
- 2024-03-18 10:45 UTC — Audited `_apply_reassign_override_effect` and verified missing return statement plus lack of explicit handling for reversed override status.
- 2024-03-18 11:05 UTC — Implemented status-aware assignment reconciliation that updates reviewer cadence counters and returns a float delta for both executed and reversed overrides. Stored reconciled assignment state per baseline and ensured float-safe return semantics.

## Resolution Summary
Added explicit status validation, normalized reviewer assignment sets for executed vs reversed overrides, and returned the net assignment delta as a float. Governance analytics tests now execute without ladder delta type errors.
